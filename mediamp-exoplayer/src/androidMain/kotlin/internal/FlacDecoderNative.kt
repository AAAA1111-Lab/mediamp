/**
 * JNI surface of the bundled FLAC software decoder (`libmediamp_flac.so`).
 *
 * The native side is a pure push model: [nativeDecodeFrame] takes exactly one FLAC frame and the
 * codec configuration, wraps them in a minimal self-contained FLAC stream, decodes it with the
 * bundled dr_flac, and writes interleaved 32-bit PCM to [outputBuffer]. See
 * `src/cpp/flac/flac_jni.cpp` for the C++ contract and [FlacFrameAccumulator] for why a container
 * sample has to be reassembled into a frame first.
 *
 * Touching this object loads the native library, so nothing a host test needs may live here; use
 * [FlacStreamInfo] for the pure parts.
 *
 * Every method is static and takes no locks: a decoder instance owns its buffers and is only
 * driven from the playback thread.
